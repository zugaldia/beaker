# Beaker

Beaker is an entry to the [Startup Weekend challenge](https://www.facebook.com/startupweekend/app_183778415022263).

The UI is inspired on the Startup Weekend website and their Erlenmeyer flask logo.

It uses [deviceorientation](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html) to move the bubbles in the screen when your tilt your laptop or tablet.

## IDEAS

* Suggest an event based on user location.

* Update the text in the sharing button with details of a particular event. There's some code already there but it doesn't seem to work.

## CREDITS

The grass, beaker, and fire images come from the [Open Clip Art](http://openclipart.org). I claim no rights on any of these images and you should check with the website before using any of those pictures in your projects.

The bubble dynamics is based on the Ball Pool [Chrome Experiment](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/ball-pool/) by Mr.doob.

Google+ functionality is largely based on the examples from the [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/+) website.

The physcis engine is powered by [Box2DJS](http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/) which is a really old project and I wished there was something newer better documented.
